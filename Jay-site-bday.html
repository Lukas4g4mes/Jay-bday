			<p>I wanted to give you something for this <strong>special day</strong>. I didn't have may ideas until this one came up.<br/>I just want to say that I am very grateful to call you a friend, you are determined, amazingly sweet, and always a joy to be around.<br/>I know it's not much but I want to offer you a list with familiar french sentences (with pronounciations tips) that you could use with your swiss friend one day.<br/> Once again, <strong>happy birthday and thank you for being my friend.</strong>
